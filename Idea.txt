# Predicting whether the passengers survived or died by the given predictors

# Thought1:
# Running logistic regression (survived or died)~ . (all predictors)
# Using step wise methods to find the "important variables"
# Data/model Validation

null <- glm(Y ~ X1, family=binomial, data=titanictanic[train,])
full <- glm(Y ~., family=binomial, data=titanic[train,])
reg <- step(null, scope=formula(full), direction="forward", k=log(n))
